# latex-notes-compilations
Master repository for Peeter's various latex notes compilations and/or books.

Most of the submodules found in this repository represent a single book or notes compilation, or the figures for that item.

Many of these were previously part of the (monolithic) physicsplay repository, but some of those ~/physicsplay/ dependencies
still exist.
